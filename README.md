# Lexical-Automatic-Machine-Translation-Evaluation-Metrics-Research
This research paper aims to study and compare different lexical automatic machine translation evaluation metrics for Indic languages. With the rise of machine translation systems, it has become essential to evaluate the quality of translations produced by these systems. However, the existing evaluation metrics designed for English and other European languages may not be suitable for Indic languages due to their complex morphology and syntax. Therefore, this study evaluates four different metrics, namely, BLEU, METEOR, TER, and NIST to identify the most suitable evaluation metric for IndicÂ languages.
